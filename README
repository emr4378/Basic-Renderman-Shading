My Shaders
------------------

EdDisplacement	- generates terrain on a surface
EdSurface		- colors terrain on a surface (given it's height values)
EdLensFlare		- generic lens flare class; copied from source below.
EdPhong			- basic Phong shading shader, used for moon
RManNotes		- filled with helpful stuffs, pulled from source below.

------------------
Renderman-1.tiff 
------------------
The first assignment; a new image created by modifying instance variables in 
the code I was given.


------------------
------------------
Renderman-2a.tiff
------------------
The first part of the second assignment; a new image created by applying three
new shaders to the surfaces in the scene.

Sphere shader source:

Wall shader source:

Floor shader source:

------------------
------------------
Renderman-2b.tiff
------------------
The second part of the second assignment; shows the results of changing some 
parameters of the shaders.

I basically made the sphere/apple greener and a bit rougher, changed the 
colors and tile widths of the wall texture, and changed the recursion depth for
the floor texture (Mandlebrot).


------------------
------------------
Renderman-3.tiff
------------------
The third assignment; a completely new image, using shaders of my own creation 
and shaders I found.

I wanted to have a sweet-ass nebula cloud thing going on in the background, but
for whatever reason clouds will not render on my computer (copied the example
code from Advanced Renderman book and it still wouldn't work). Oh well.
